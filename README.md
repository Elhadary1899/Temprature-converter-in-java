Conquering Temperature with OOP: A Java Temperature Converter<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone!  I'm excited to share a project I recently completed: a temperature converter built entirely in Java! This wasn't your average converter - I  dove deep into the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) to create a robust and versatile solution.<br/>
<br/>
Key Features:
<br/>
• Multiple Scales: Convert between Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit with ease. <br/>
• OOP Fundamentals: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction are all implemented for clean, maintainable, and reusable code.<br/>
• Exception Handling: The project anticipates and gracefully handles potential errors to ensure a smooth user experience.<br/>
• User-Friendly validations: Say goodbye to invalid inputs! The project ensures all user entries are valid for accurate conversions.<br/>
<br/>
This project was a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to solidify my OOP concepts while building a practical application.
